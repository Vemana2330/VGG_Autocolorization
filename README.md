# VGG_Autocolorization

## Overview
This project focuses on restoring black-and-white images by applying deep learning-based automatic colorization. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning from a pre-trained VGG16 model, the system generates vibrant and realistic color images from grayscale inputs.
